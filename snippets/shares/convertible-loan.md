USAGE NOTES:

This snippet covers both ISSUANCE and CONVERSION of convertible loans.

What is a convertible loan?
- Debt instrument that can convert into equity
- Common bridge financing tool between equity rounds
- Defers valuation discussion to future financing round
- Lenders typically receive discount or valuation cap as compensation for early risk

Key terms to negotiate:

1. Interest rate: Typically 3-8% for startups
2. Maturity: Often 12-24 months
3. Conversion trigger:
   - Qualified Financing (auto-conversion when raising ≥ threshold amount)
   - Optional conversion (lender's choice)
   - Maturity (auto-conversion if not repaid)

4. Conversion price:
   - Fixed price (simple but rare)
   - Discount to next round (e.g., 20% discount)
   - Valuation cap (price = cap ÷ pre-money shares)
   - Discount OR cap, whichever is better for lender (most investor-friendly)

5. Security: Usually unsecured for startups

Legal framework:

Issuance:
- Loan agreement governed by contract law
- Board can usually approve (check articles for limits on borrowing)
- No PRH filing for loan itself (just a liability)

Conversion:
- Conversion creates share issuance → OYL Chapter 9 applies
- If convertible loan terms approved by GM with pre-emption waiver, no further GM approval needed for conversion
- If only Board approved loan issuance, GM approval needed for conversion (with pre-emption waiver if directed)
- PRH filing required upon conversion (share capital change)

Pre-emption rights:
- Shareholders have pre-emption rights on share issuances (OYL 9:3)
- Conversion = share issuance → pre-emption applies unless waived
- Best practice: GM waives pre-emption when approving loan terms (anticipated conversion)
- Requires 2/3 majority and "weighty financial reason"

Qualified Financing mechanics:
- Example: "QF = raising ≥EUR 500k in single equity financing"
- Triggers automatic conversion at discount/cap
- Aligns bridge investor interests with priced round investors
- Discount rewards early risk (e.g., 20% means if Series A is EUR 10/share, loan converts at EUR 8/share)
- Cap protects investor if valuation very high (e.g., EUR 5M cap means conversion price cannot exceed cap ÷ shares outstanding, even if next round values company much higher)

Valuation cap example:
- Cap: EUR 5M
- Pre-money shares: 1M
- Implied conversion price: EUR 5/share
- If Series A price is EUR 10/share, loan still converts at EUR 5/share (50% discount)
- If Series A price is EUR 3/share, loan converts at EUR 3/share (discount doesn't apply, actual round price better)

Common mistakes to avoid:
- Not getting GM approval with pre-emption waiver at issuance (forces GM approval at conversion, can be difficult)
- Unclear conversion trigger definition (what counts as Qualified Financing?)
- Forgetting about accrued interest (converts along with principal)
- Not specifying fractional share treatment
- Not updating shareholder register after conversion

Accounting treatment:
- Initially recorded as liability (debt)
- Interest accrues and increases liability
- Upon conversion, liability extinguished, equity increased
- No gain/loss on conversion (debt becomes equity at book value)

Tax considerations:
- Interest may be tax deductible for company
- Lenders pay tax on interest income
- Conversion typically not taxable event
- Consult tax advisor for specific treatment

REMEMBER to:
- Update /reference/share-capital.md after conversion
- File with PRH within 2 months of conversion
- Discharge any security if secured loan
- Update cap table with new shareholders
- Ensure SHA adherence if applicable
- Track remaining authorized shares if conversion uses authorisation
