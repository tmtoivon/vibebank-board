## Resolution {{N}}: Determination of Signatory Rights

### Background

The Board considered the determination of signatory rights (nimenkirjoitusoikeus) for the company.

### Legal Basis

This determination is made in accordance with Chapter 6, Section 25 of the Finnish Companies Act (osakeyhtiölaki 624/2006, "OYL 6:25"), which provides that the Board of Directors determines who may sign for the company and how the company shall be represented.

{{ARTICLES_PROVISION}}

<!-- If Articles contain provisions on signatory rights:
"The Articles of Association (§{{SECTION}}) provide that {{ARTICLES_TEXT}}."

If no provision:
"The Articles of Association do not specify signatory rights; the Board has full discretion under OYL 6:25."
-->

### Types of Signatory Rights

There are two main types of signatory rights in Finnish law:

1. **Prokura** (commercial power of attorney, OYL 6:26-27):
   - Extensive authority to represent the company
   - Covers all legal acts within company's business
   - Cannot be limited (except jointly with another prokura holder)
   - More formal, traditional form

2. **General signatory rights** (nimenkirjoitusoikeus, OYL 6:25):
   - Authority as determined by Board
   - Can be limited by scope, amount, or co-signature requirements
   - More flexible, commonly used
   - This resolution addresses general signatory rights

### Current Signatory Rights

The Board noted the current signatory rights as filed with PRH:

{{CURRENT_SIGNATORIES}}

<!-- Example:
| Person | Rights |
|--------|--------|
| {{NAME_1}} | Alone |
| {{NAME_2}} | Jointly with another signatory |
| {{NAME_3}} | Prokura |
-->

### Revised Signatory Rights

The Board resolved to determine signatory rights as follows:

#### {{CATEGORY_1}}: Sole Signatory Rights

The following persons may **sign alone** for the company:

{{SOLE_SIGNATORIES}}

<!-- Example:
- **{{NAME_1}}**, {{ROLE_1}} (e.g., Managing Director)
- **{{NAME_2}}**, {{ROLE_2}} (e.g., Chair of the Board)

If sole signatory:
"{{NAME}} is authorised to sign alone for the company in all matters."

If sole signatory with limits:
"{{NAME}} is authorised to sign alone for the company in matters {{LIMITATION}}."

Common limitations:
- "not exceeding EUR {{AMOUNT}}"
- "within the ordinary course of business"
- "relating to {{SCOPE}}"
-->

#### {{CATEGORY_2}}: Joint Signatory Rights

The following persons may **sign jointly** (two together) for the company:

{{JOINT_SIGNATORIES}}

<!-- Example:
- **{{NAME_A}}**, {{ROLE_A}}
- **{{NAME_B}}**, {{ROLE_B}}
- **{{NAME_C}}**, {{ROLE_C}}

"Any two of the above persons signing together may bind the company."

Or specific pairings:
"The company is bound by the signatures of:
- {{NAME_A}} together with {{NAME_B}}, OR
- {{NAME_A}} together with {{NAME_C}}"
-->

#### {{CATEGORY_3}}: Prokura (if applicable)

{{PROKURA_HOLDERS}}

<!-- If granting prokura:
"The Board resolved to grant prokura (commercial power of attorney) to:

- **{{NAME}}**, {{ROLE}}

Prokura grants authority to {{NAME}} to represent the company in all legal acts within the scope of the company's business, in accordance with OYL 6:26.

{{PROKURA_LIMITATIONS}}"

Common prokura limitations (only joint exercise can be required):
- "{{NAME_1}} may exercise prokura alone, OR {{NAME_1}} and {{NAME_2}} must exercise jointly"
- "{{NAME}} may not exercise prokura jointly with {{PERSON}} (if restriction needed)"

If no prokura:
"The Board did not grant prokura to any person."
-->

### Scope and Limitations

{{SCOPE_AND_LIMITATIONS}}

<!-- Examples:

For general signatory rights:
"Signatory rights apply to all legal acts on behalf of the company, subject to the following limitations:

1. **Amount limits**: {{AMOUNT_LIMITATIONS}}
2. **Subject matter limits**: {{SCOPE_LIMITATIONS}}
3. **Board approval required**: Signatories must obtain prior Board approval for {{MATTERS_REQUIRING_APPROVAL}}

These limitations are internal (between company and signatory) and do not affect third parties dealing with the company in good faith."

For unlimited rights:
"Signatory rights are unlimited. Signatories may bind the company in all matters on behalf of the company."
-->

### Internal vs External Effect

The Board noted that:

{{INTERNAL_VS_EXTERNAL}}

<!-- Standard explanation:
"**External effect** (third parties):
- Signatory rights as filed with PRH bind the company vis-à-vis third parties
- Third parties can rely on PRH register
- Company cannot claim internal limitations against third parties acting in good faith

**Internal effect** (signatories):
- Signatories must comply with Board's instructions and limitations
- Breach of internal limits = breach of duty to company
- Signatory may be personally liable for unauthorized acts
- Does not void the transaction with third party"
-->

### Specific Authorization

{{SPECIFIC_AUTHORIZATIONS}}

<!-- If granting specific authority for certain types of transactions:

"In addition to general signatory rights, the Board specifically authorised:

1. **{{NAME_A}}** to {{SPECIFIC_AUTHORITY_A}} (e.g., "sign all employment contracts")
2. **{{NAME_B}}** to {{SPECIFIC_AUTHORITY_B}} (e.g., "operate bank accounts and execute payment instructions")
3. **{{NAME_C}}** to {{SPECIFIC_AUTHORITY_C}} (e.g., "sign tax returns and filings with authorities")

These specific authorizations are in addition to general signatory rights and remain in effect until revoked by the Board."
-->

### Revocation of Previous Rights

{{REVOCATION}}

<!-- Options:

Full revocation:
"The Board resolved to **revoke all previously granted signatory rights**. The signatory rights determined in this resolution supersede all previous determinations."

Specific revocation:
"The Board resolved to **revoke** the signatory rights previously granted to:
- {{NAME_1}} (revoked effective {{DATE}})
- {{NAME_2}} (revoked effective {{DATE}})

All other previously granted signatory rights remain in effect."

No revocation:
"Previous signatory rights remain in effect to the extent not inconsistent with this resolution."
-->

Following this resolution, the complete signatory rights of the company are:

<!-- Limits examples: "None" / "Up to EUR {{AMOUNT}}" / "Ordinary business only" -->

### Bank Accounts and Payment Authorization

USAGE NOTES:

This snippet is for DETERMINING SIGNATORY RIGHTS (nimenkirjoitusoikeus).

Legal framework:

Authority to determine (OYL 6:25):
- Board of Directors determines signatory rights
- Board can change rights at any time
- Articles may contain default provisions

Types of signatory rights:

1. **Sole signatory** (yksin):
   - Person can sign alone for company
   - Most efficient, highest trust
   - Typically: MD, Chair, or senior executives
   - Company fully bound by sole signatory's signature

2. **Joint signatories** (yhdessä toisen kanssa):
   - Two or more must sign together
   - Provides control and reduces risk
   - Common for financial matters
   - Options:
     - "Any two together"
     - "Specific person + one other"
     - "Specific pairings only"

3. **Prokura** (OYL 6:26-27):
   - Extensive commercial power of attorney
   - Authority for all acts within company's business
   - Cannot be limited (except joint exercise requirement)
   - More formal, less common today
   - Specific legal regime under OYL

Prokura vs general signatory rights:
- Prokura: Defined by law, broad, formal
- General rights: Defined by Board, flexible, common
- Both must be filed with PRH
- Prokura somewhat outdated; general rights more common

Limitations:

Internal limitations (Board can impose):
- Amount limits (e.g., "up to EUR 50,000")
- Subject matter (e.g., "ordinary business only")
- Co-approval requirements (e.g., "with Board approval for X")

External effect:
- Third parties can rely on PRH register
- Internal limitations don't protect company against third parties in good faith
- Signatory who exceeds authority breaches duty to company but transaction valid

Who should have signatory rights:
- Managing Director (if appointed): typically sole or primary
- Chair of Board: often sole or joint
- CFO/senior executives: often joint or limited
- Directors: may or may not have rights (not automatic)

Best practices:
- Align with roles and responsibilities
- Consider risk (sole vs joint)
- Clear limitations for accountability
- Regular review and updates
- Fewer signatories = easier administration
- More signatories = better control

PRH filing:
- File YTJ2 within 2 months
- Information required: name, DOB, signatory rights type
- Effective when registered (public can rely on register)
- Filing fee applies

Bank accounts:
- Banks require separate mandate forms
- Bank mandates often more restrictive than general rights
- Common structure: higher amounts require multiple signatures
- Update banks when PRH filing complete

Common scenarios:

**Small company**: MD signs alone, or any two directors jointly

**Growing company**: MD alone up to limit; MD + CFO jointly above limit

**Mature company**:
- MD alone for operations
- CFO alone for routine finance
- Two executives jointly for major contracts
- Board approval for strategic matters

Revoking signatory rights:
- Board can revoke at any time
- Good practice: notify person of revocation
- File revocation with PRH
- Update banks immediately
- Important when: director resigns, MD terminated, person leaves company

Responsibilities of signatories:
- Act within authority
- Comply with Board's instructions
- Act in company's best interests
- Can be personally liable for:
  - Exceeding authority (internal breach)
  - Fraudulent acts
  - Violations of law

Typical mistakes:
- Not filing with PRH (invalid against third parties)
- Not updating banks (can't actually use rights)
- Granting too many sole signatories (control risk)
- Vague limitations (disputes)
- Not revoking when person leaves
- Assuming directors automatically have rights (they don't)

REMEMBER to:
- File with PRH within 2 months
- Update all bank mandates
- Notify signatories of their rights and limitations
- Revoke rights when person leaves company
- Update company documents
- Review signatory rights annually or when management changes
- Document internal limitations clearly
