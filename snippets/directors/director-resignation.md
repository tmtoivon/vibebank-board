USAGE NOTES:

This snippet is for RECORDING and ACCEPTING director resignations.

Legal framework:

Right to resign (OYL 6:9):
- Director can resign at any time
- No approval required (resignation is unilateral act)
- Resignation effective per director's notice (immediately or specified date)
- Articles may specify notice period (but cannot prevent resignation)

Board's role:
- Acknowledge and record resignation
- Check compliance with minimum board size requirements
- Plan for replacement if needed
- File notification with PRH

Effectiveness:
- Resignation effective when communicated to Board (or on later date specified)
- Board "accepts" resignation as acknowledgment, not approval
- Resignation cannot be withdrawn after effective date without re-appointment

Minimum Board size (OYL 6:4):
- Oy: Minimum 1 director
- Oy with no auditor: Minimum 3 directors
- Articles may require more
- If resignation causes non-compliance: urgent GM needed to appoint replacement

Replacement process:
- Only General Meeting can appoint directors (unless articles provide otherwise)
- Board can recommend candidates to GM
- Consider calling EGM if replacement urgent
- Temporary operations may continue with reduced board if minimum met

Chair resignation:
- If Chair resigns, new Chair must be elected
- Board can elect new Chair (unless articles require GM to elect)
- Good practice: elect new Chair promptly for continuity

PRH filing:
- File YTJ2 within 2 months
- Report resignation effective date
- Update board composition in trade register
- No filing fee for resignation notification

Practical considerations:
- Express thanks/acknowledgment (good practice, maintains relationships)
- Ensure smooth transition of responsibilities
- Return of company property (laptop, documents, access cards)
- Revoke access to systems and confidential information
- Consider D&O insurance "tail coverage" for acts during tenure
- Update signatory rights if resigning director had signing authority

Resignation vs. removal:
- Resignation: Voluntary, by director's choice
- Removal (OYL 6:9): Involuntary, by GM decision
- Use this snippet for resignation only
- For removal, use separate process (GM resolution)

Shareholder Agreement implications:
- Check if SHA has provisions on director appointments
- Resigning director may have been designated by specific shareholder
- That shareholder may have right to nominate replacement
- Inform relevant shareholders

Potential issues:
- Mass resignations leaving board below minimum
- Resignation just before important decision (continuity risk)
- Resignation due to governance disputes (may signal issues)
- Resignation of Chair (leadership continuity)

REMEMBER to:
- Update /reference/directors-register.md with resignation date
- File with PRH within 2 months
- Remove from all company systems and distribution lists
- Check and update signatory rights
- Plan replacement if board below optimal/required size
- Thank director appropriately
- Check SHA provisions
