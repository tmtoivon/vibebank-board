Legal framework (OYL Chapter 6):

Requirement (OYL 6:12):
- Not mandatory for Oy (optional)
- Articles may require MD
- Good practice for active companies to have MD

Appointment authority (OYL 6:12):
- Board of Directors appoints MD (not GM)
- Board determines MD's duties and authority
- Board can remove MD at any time

Eligibility:
- Natural person (not company)

- Execute Board decisions
- Provide Board with necessary information
- Not authorised to make decisions "unusual or far-reaching" without Board approval

Relationship with Board:
- MD subordinate to Board
- Board supervises MD
- Board can instruct MD
- MD typically attends Board meetings (but no vote unless also director)

MD as Board member:
- Legally permitted
- Not recommended (governance separation)
- Common in small companies
- If MD is director: should not chair Board (conflict)
- MD-director should recuse from decisions about own employment/performance

Delegation of authority:
- Board determines what MD can decide alone
- Typical thresholds: contract value, capex, hiring level
- "Day-to-day" vs "unusual" is fact-dependent
- Clear delegation avoids disputes and ensures efficiency

Employment relationship:
- MD typically has employment contract
- Subject to employment law protections
- Notice periods, termination rules apply
- Can also be engaged as consultant (less common)
- Remuneration determined by Board

Signatory rights:

Common structures:
1. **Small Oy**: No MD, Board manages directly
2. **Medium Oy**: MD handles operations, Board sets strategy
3. **Larger Oy**: MD + management team, Board supervises
4. **Startup**: Founder often serves as both director and MD

Remuneration:
- Determined by Board (not GM like director fees)
- Can include salary, bonus, equity, benefits
- Equity often via option grants (see option snippets)
- Benchmark against market rates

Best practices:
- Written employment contract (clarity)
