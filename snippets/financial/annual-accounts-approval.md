USAGE NOTES:

This snippet is for APPROVING annual accounts at the AGM.

Legal framework:

Requirement (OYL 5:3):
- AGM must adopt (approve) financial statements
- Must be held within 6 months of financial year end
- Example: FY ends 31.12.2024 → AGM by 30.06.2025

Financial statements content (KPL):
Required components:
- Balance sheet
- Income statement
- Notes
- Board's report (if criteria met per KPL 3:1a)

Optional:
- Cash flow statement (required for larger companies)
- Consolidated statements (required if subsidiaries)

Preparation responsibility:
- Board prepares financial statements (OYL 6:2)
- Must be based on proper accounting
- Auditor reviews (if not waived)

Audit requirement (OYL 6:1):
- Mandatory for larger companies
- Can be waived for small companies if:
  - Max 1 of following criteria exceeded in FY and prior FY:
    - Balance sheet EUR 350,000
    - Revenue EUR 700,000
    - Employees 10
- Must have 3+ directors if audit waived

Auditor's opinion types:
1. **Unqualified**: No issues, financial statements present fairly
2. **Qualified**: Issues identified but not pervasive
3. **Adverse**: Material misstatements, not presented fairly
4. **Disclaimer**: Unable to obtain sufficient evidence

AGM process:
1. Board prepares financial statements
2. Auditor audits (if required) and issues report
3. Financial statements distributed to shareholders before AGM
4. Presented at AGM (typically by Board Chair or CFO)
5. AGM discusses and asks questions
6. AGM votes to adopt (approve)
7. AGM decides on profit distribution (separate resolution)
8. AGM grants discharge to Board and MD (separate resolution)

Distributable equity (OYL 13:1):
Components:
- Retained earnings
- Profit for the year
- Invested unrestricted equity fund (SVOP)
Less:
- Losses
- Restricted amounts (e.g., capitalized development costs)

Dividend restrictions:
- Cannot exceed distributable equity
- Must pass solvency test (company can pay debts)
- Board must assess prudent amount considering company needs

Filing requirement (KPL 3:7a):
- File with PRH within specified time
- Electronically via XBRL format
- Publicly available after filing
- Late filing may result in penalties

Timing considerations:
- FY ends → Board prepares → Auditor audits → AGM approves (within 6 months)
- Example timeline for FY ending 31.12.2024:
  - Jan-Mar 2025: Board prepares financial statements
  - Apr 2025: Auditor completes audit
  - May 2025: AGM approves
  - By Jun 2025: Filed with PRH

Consequences of not approving:
- Financial statements not official
- Cannot distribute dividends
- Cannot grant discharge
- Directors may be personally liable for management during period
- Required filing cannot be made

Amending financial statements:
- If AGM rejects: Board must prepare amended statements
- Auditor must re-audit amended statements
- New AGM to approve amended statements
- Rare; typically resolved before AGM

Best practices:
- Distribute financial statements to shareholders in advance (at least with AGM notice)
- Allow sufficient time for shareholder questions
- Auditor should attend AGM if significant matters
- Board should be prepared to explain key items
- Document any questions and Board's responses in minutes

REMEMBER to:
- File with PRH after AGM approval
- Proceed to dividend and discharge resolutions
- Store original signed statements at registered office
- Update reference files with current financial position
- Provide copies to stakeholders as needed
