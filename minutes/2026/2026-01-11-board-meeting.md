### Resolution 1: Issuance of Options

#### Background

The Board considered the issuance of options under the **Employee Options Plan 2025.02** to Bruce Willis, employee of the company (Actor).

#### Legal Basis and Authorisation

This issuance is made pursuant to:
- The Employee Options Plan 2025.02 adopted by the General Meeting
- The authorisation granted to the Board by the General Meeting to issue options under the plan
- Chapter 10 of the Finnish Companies Act (osakeyhtiölaki 624/2006)

The Board confirmed that:

#### Option Grant

The Board resolved to grant options as follows:

| Recipient | Role/Relationship | Number of Options | Exercise Price per Share | Vesting Commencement | Expiry Date |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Bruce Willis | Actor (Employee) | 1 500 | EUR 0.50 | 11.01.2026 | 11.01.2036 |
| **Total** | | **1 500** | | | |

#### Vesting Schedule

The options shall vest as follows:

**4-year vesting with 1-year cliff**: 25% (375 options) vest on 11.01.2027, then 1/48 of the total grant (approximately 31.25 options) vests monthly thereafter on the 11th day of each month.

Vesting is subject to the recipient's continued employment with the company.

#### Exercise Terms

- **Bad leaver** (termination for cause, breach of contract): All options (vested and unvested) forfeit immediately upon termination.
- **Death or disability**: All unvested options vest immediately; estate or recipient has 12 months from date of death/disability to exercise.

#### Dilution Update

The Board noted the following dilution impact:

| Metric | Before This Grant | After This Grant |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Options granted under Employee Options Plan 2025.02 | 1 000 | 2 500 |
| Options remaining in pool | To be determined | To be determined |
| Current share capital | 10 000 shares | 10 000 shares |
| Fully diluted share capital | 11 000 shares | 12 500 shares |
