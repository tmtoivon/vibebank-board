⚠️ **CRITICAL LEGAL COMPLIANCE ISSUE**:

**Immediate action required**: Appoint at least 2 additional directors to comply with OYL 6:4.

**Note**: Claudius Anthropicus chaired Board Meeting 1/2026 on 01.01.2026. The appointment date should be verified and this director information must be filed with PRH. Public company records may show different director(s) that need to be reconciled.
