## Notes

**Financial Status:**
- Company incorporated 13.06.2022
- FY 2023 performance: Revenue EUR 1,000, Loss EUR 6,000
- Current equity position: EUR -3,500 (negative)
- **No distributable funds** available for dividends

**Option Plan Impact:**
- 1,000 options granted to Senna Koiranen at EUR 0.42 exercise price
- If exercised: Additional share capital of EUR 250 (1,000 shares × EUR 0.25 par)
- Additional EUR 170 would go to share premium (1,000 × (EUR 0.42 - EUR 0.25))
- Post-exercise equity: EUR -3,500 + EUR 420 = EUR -3,080
- Dilution to founder: From 100% to 90.91%

**Option Exercise Price Rationale:**
- Exercise price EUR 0.42 per share
- Current book value per share: EUR -0.35 (negative equity ÷ 10,000 shares)
- Exercise price represents approximately 40% premium to potential future valuation target
